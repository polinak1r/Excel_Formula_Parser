# Excel Formula Parser

## Overview

Welcome to the Excel Formula Parser project! This tool is designed to parse and evaluate formulas similar to those you might find in a spreadsheet application. Whether you're a developer aiming to integrate formula parsing into your project or just a curious enthusiast, this parser has you covered.

## Supported Features

Our formula parser supports a range of powerful operators and functions, ensuring you can work with complex calculations easily. Here's a closer look at the capabilities:

### Parentheses
- **What it does:** Use parentheses `()` to control the order of operations and group expressions.

### Binary Operators
- **Supported operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Details:**
  - `+` Combines two numbers. 
  - `-` Subtracts one number from another.
  - `*` Multiplies two numbers. 
  - `/` Divides one number by another.

### Unary Operator
- **Supported operator:** `-`
- **Details:** This operator negates a number, turning positive values into negative ones and vice versa. 

### Functions
- **Supported functions:** `max`, `min`, `sin`, `cos`, `pow`
- **Details:**
  - `max(a, b, ...)`: Returns the largest value among the arguments. Example: `max(3, 5, 2) = 5`.
  - `min(a, b, ...)`: Returns the smallest value among the arguments. Example: `min(3, 5, 2) = 2`.
  - `sin(x)`: Computes the sine of `x` (in radians). Example: `sin(Ï€/2) = 1`.
  - `cos(x)`: Computes the cosine of `x` (in radians). Example: `cos(0) = 1`.
  - `pow(base, exponent)`: Raises `base` to the power of `exponent`. Example: `pow(2, 3) = 8`.

### Cell References
- **What it does:** Refers to data in spreadsheet-style cells, such as `A1`, `B2`, etc.
  
## How to Run

Getting started with the Excel Formula Parser is quick and easy! Just follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Project**
   - Begin by downloading the repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/polinak1r/Excel_Formula_Parser.git
     ```
   - This will create a local copy of the project that you can work with.

2. **Open the Project**
   - Launch your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) and open the cloned project. 
   - Ensure the dependencies are properly configured in your environment.

3. **Run the `Main` Class**
   - Locate the `Main` class in the project structure. This is the entry point of the application.
   - Execute the `Main` class to start parsing formulas. Youâ€™ll see the output directly in the console.

4. **Run the Tests**
   - Testing is crucial to confirm that everything is working as expected. Run the test suite included in the project:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew test
     ```
   - The tests will validate that all operators, functions, and features of the parser are functioning correctly. Any issues will be highlighted for you to address.

5. **Experiment and Explore**
   - Once the setup is complete, you can start experimenting with different formulas. Try a mix of operators, functions, and cell references to see the parser in action.
